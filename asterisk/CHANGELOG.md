# Changelog

## 5.3.0

### New Features

- Add health check for the add-on ([#344](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/344))
- Allow to disable ingress entry registration ([#393](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/393))

### Upgrades

- Update Asterisk from 22.2.0 to 22.4.1
- Update debian-base from 7.7.1 to 7.8.3
- Update app_rtsp_sip from 1.0 to 2.0 (closes [#374](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/374))

### Documentation

- Fix add-on configuration path in documentation from `/addon_configs/b35499aa-asterisk` to `/addon_configs/b35499aa_asterisk`.

## 5.2.0

- Enable HAOS Ingress

## 5.1.0

### Breaking Changes

- Migrate Asterisk files out of Home Assistant config directory

  - This ensures the add-on backup and restore includes the Asterisk files
  - Apart from the automatic migration, if your Asterisk files refer to files in the Home Assistant config dir, like scripts, their references must be **manually changed** from `/config/` to `/homeassistant/`.

    Note: this breaking change was realized after 5.1.0 was initially released. Otherwise, this release would have been 6.0.0.

### Upgrades

- Upgrade Asterisk from 22.1.0 to 22.2.0
- Upgrade debian-base from 7.6.2 to 7.7.1

## 5.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- `chan_sip` was [removed](https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Channel-Drivers/SIP/Configuring-chan_sip/) in Asterisk 21, thus it is no longer supported by this add-on.
  You should [migrate](https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Channel-Drivers/SIP/Configuring-res_pjsip/Migrating-from-chan_sip-to-res_pjsip/) to `res_pjsip` if you were using `chan_sip`.

  [general]
  nameserver = 127.0.0.1
  resolv =
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the permissions of downloaded sounds to be `0755` to be as indicated by <https://asterisksounds.org>, although on my tests it was working before as well.

### Upgrades

  - This upgrades Debian 11 to Debian 12
- Upgrade Asterisk from 20.2.1 to 20.4.0

## 4.0.4

## 4.0.2

- Fix add-on not starting for ARM users

## 4.0.1

- Fix `auto_add_secret` validation always failing as if it was net set

## 4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

Some default options for the add-on configuration have been switched:

- `generate_ssl_cert` is now enabled by default.
- `video_support` is now disabled by default. It barely worked anyway.

Make sure to check the add-on configuration page after updating the add-on to ensure your configuration is still correct.

### New Features

Now the add-on can be run as a standalone docker container:

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/tech7fox/asterisk-hass-addon:4.0.0
```

- An example `docker-compose.yml` file is available [here](../docker-compose.yaml).
- Make sure to mount a `config` folder to `/config` and a `media` folder to `/media` to ensure the add-on can access your configuration and media files.
- To configure the add-on options you can use the `/config/config.json` file. The default options can be seen [here](./rootfs/usr/share/asterisk/config.json).
- If you enable `auto_add` to automatically create extensions for every Person in your Home Assistant, make sure to also set:
  - The `HA_TOKEN` environment variable with your Home Assistant long-lived access token
  - The `HA_URL`, unless <https://homeassistant.local:8123> resolves to your Home Assistant instance

Also, you can now use absolute paths in the `certfile` and `keyfile` options.

### Cleanups

The add-on no longer sends discovery information for the Asterisk integration in Home Assistant. This never worked anyway, and if in the future it does, we can restore it.

## 3.2.0

### New Features

There is now a new option for the add-on: _Additional Sounds Languages to Download_.

With this option, you can specify a list of languages to download sounds from <https://www.asterisksounds.org/> on the add-on startup.

These sounds will be downloaded to `/media/asterisk`, and the add-on will not download the sounds in case they were downloaded already.

These sounds will be available to use in Asterisk by changing the language as you would do normally. For example, you can put `pt-BR` in the list of additional sounds to download, and then change the Asterisk configuration to use `pt_BR` as language.

Finally, now the add-on is able to access files on `/media`, which means you can store your custom music and sounds there, and then refer to them in the Asterisk configuration files.

### Changes

All the available options will now appear in the add-on configuration page without having to click in _Show unused options_, which was an actually misleading name.

Also, the default log level is now _INFO_ instead of _NOTICE_, which increases the logging a little bit.

## 3.1.0

### New Features

- The add-on now supports the `hassio.stdin` Home Assistant service to execute any Asterisk CLI commands. For example, to reload changes from `/config/asterisk/custom/extensions.conf`:

  ```yaml
  service: hassio.addon_stdin
    data:
      addon: b35499aa_asterisk
      input: dialplan reload
  ```

  This means that you can now use the full power of Asterisk CLI right from your Home Assistant automations!

### Changes

- Use symbolic links to map custom Asterisk config files

  - Previously, the custom Asterisk config files would be copied over the default files on container startup
  - With the new approach, for example, the Asterisk CLI command to reload extensions after changing the `/config/asterisk/custom/extensions.conf` will work without requiring to restart the whole add-on.

## 3.0.2

- Fix `asterisk_mbox.ini` configuration again

## 3.0.1

- Fix `asterisk_mbox.ini` configuration

## 3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

We changed the way we handle the Asterisk config files and this will require a manual action on your side. Now, Asterisk files you intend to modify should be placed under `/config/asterisk/custom`. For example, if you were previously editing `extensions.conf`, you should move it from `/config/asterisk/extensions.conf` to `/config/asterisk/custom/extensions.conf`.

After moving all the files you need to `/config/asterisk/custom`, you can also cleanup the `/config/asterisk` folder by deleting everything under it, **except for the `custom` folder**.

### New Features

Previously, both the default and custom Asterisk config files were being written and read from `/config/asterisk`, which posed some issues related to upgrading the add-on as the config files written by an old version of the add-on would get read by the new version of the add-on as if they were user customized files. This also meant that, if users wanted to receive the new Asterisk default config files, they would have to delete everything from `/config/asterisk` that was not customized manually before starting the container.

This is no longer required, and now default files will be always upgraded, while still retaining custom files between upgrades. This will require a manual action from you if you are upgrading this add-on from previous versions, see above.

- The default Asterisk config files are now copied to `/config/asterisk/default` on every container start. The files on this folder should be used for reference only, as any changes made in this folder will be overwritten in the container startup.
- The custom Asterisk config files are now read from `/config/asterisk/custom` instead of from `/config/asterisk`.
- You can now override/customize any Asterisk files (previously, the auto-generated Asterisk files could not be overriden).

### Upgrades

- Bump Asterisk from 20.1.0 to 20.2.0
- Bump debian-base from 6.2.0 to 6.2.3

## 2.4.0

- Add `chan_sip` (disabled by default) for Dahua VTO compatibility (by @bdherouville)

### Breaking changes

**Delete the old `sip.conf` and `modules.conf`.** This disables `chan_sip` by default and sets it on another port to prevent conflicts with `pjsip`.

## 2.3.5

- Upgrade Asterisk from 20.0.1 to 20.1.0 (by @felipecrs)

  - This is a breaking change. Check below the upgrade guide.

Lots of issues were fixed by the above.

### Upgrade guide

It's strongly recommended to erase your existing Asterisk configuration before upgrading.

1. Move any customization you have done in `/config/asterisk/` to somewhere else.
2. Delete the `/config/asterisk` folder.
3. Restore your customizations to the `/config/asterisk` folder if you have any.
4. Make sure to convert your extensions from `chan_sip` to `res_pjsip` if you have any.

Then, you can go ahead and upgrade. Next time you start the addon, it will recreate the files at `/config/asterisk`.

## 1.3.3

- Include hint settings and add busylevel to auto generated extensions.

## 1.3.2

- Fix verbose and debug log levels

## 1.3.1

- Add `log_level` option

## 1.3.0

- Remove the initial Ingress support added in 1.2.0.
  - Ingress will not be needed to make the integration and the card work without having to export additional ports or configuring additional reverse proxies (details [here](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/issues/331#issuecomment-1043671490)).
- Remove the option to disable SSL (#98)
  - Disabling SSL causes the HA-SIP card not to work anymore.
- Add an option to automatically generate a self-signed certificate (#98)
  - So that, users running Asterisk behind a reverse proxy do not need to bother about managing their own certificate to be used by Asterisk. You can directly proxy `https://<ha-ip>:8089`.

## 1.2.1

- Disable WS protocol wrongly introduced in 1.2.0 which caused issues

## 1.2.0

- Add an option to disable SSL (#66)
  - Useful for setting up Asterisk to work behind a reverse proxy like NGINX. Here is one example on how to configure NGINX to proxy the Asterisk WebSockets interface: https://warlord0blog.wordpress.com/2020/04/16/asterisk-webrtc/
  - PS: This was not tested, so any feedback is welcome.
- Add initial support for Ingress (#57)
  - Work is still required from other components like the integration and the card to effectively be able to use it.
  - Note that the WebUI shown in the addon page is not a GUI page, but rather the WebSocket connection needed by SIP.JS to connect to the SIP server.
- Fix mailbox server not working (#92)
- Disable docker builtin init, to prevent multiple init systems as we already have S6 Overlay (#89)

## 1.1.5

- Fix permission denied error in discovery service (#85)

## 1.1.4

- Send out discovery information.

## 1.1.3

- Add `host` and `port` to discovery.

## 1.1.2

- Use parking instead of conference.
- Remove default passwords.
- Update config and docs.

## 0.3.4

- Add default conference room [#54](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/54). Now you can join a conference room via 444 (for default user) or 555 (for admin user). This is useful for things like doorbells.
- Add music-on-hold. (moh)

## 0.3.3

- Add video support [#39](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/39). This feature comes disabled by default as otherwise the SIP Lovelace Card does not work in the companion app.
- Fix AMI permit. Now use `localhost` as host in the Asterisk integration.
- Add auto_add_secret option [#50](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/50). This option is to prevent having a default secret for the auto-added extensions.
